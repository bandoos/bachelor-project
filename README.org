#+TITLE: sim-core-0.1 README

* Standard mode
** Installation

    This section applies for GNU/linux systems.
    It should also work on OSX (mac) if a python (>3) and
    pip are installed.

   Download the .zip folder of the project to a location
   we will refer to as =$PROJECT_ROOT=

    The alternative is using the provided Docker image,
    which will work on GNU/linux, OSX and windows. See the
    *Docker mode* section for instructions.


    The code is bundled as a python package so,
    from the root folder of the project run:

     ~$ pip install --user -e ./~

     This will use ~pip~ to install (for the current user)
     the dependencies of the project from PyPI, and add this project
     to the =$PYTHONPATH= so it can be executed on your system.

     Thought this is not necessary for the basic functionality
     some features rely on =$HOME/.local/bin= to be in the =$PATH=.
     This is typically the case with standard linux distribution,
     but the install command will warn if this is not the case
     for you.

     If =.local/bin= is in your =$PATH= then the main entry point
     for the simulation executable is available as:

     ~$ sim-stake [OPTIONS]~


     If =.local/bin= is not in your $PATH then from the =$PROJECT_ROOT=
     run:

     ~.scripts/sim-stake [OPTIONS]~.

     In that case remember that you should always be in =$PROJECT_ROOT=
     and substitute ~sim-stake~ with ~.scripts/sim-stake~ in the following sections.


** Usage
     You can see its usage information with:

     ~$ sim-stake --help~

     #+begin_src text
usage: sim-stake [-h] [--id ID]
                 --m M --T T
                 --c C --times TIMES
                 --stake_f {eq,beta,pareto}
		 --sim {random,const,geom,log_const,log_geom}

Run a sim-stake-batch

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --id ID               unique id for the experiment

required arguments:
  --m M                 INTEGER: Indicate the number of nodes [m] (valid if >= 2)
  --T T                 INTEGER: Indicate max epoch time [T] (valid if >= 2)
  --c C                 FLOAT: Indicate total load factor "c" [R=cT] (valid if > 0)
  --times TIMES         INTEGER: Redudancy factor (valid if > 0)
  --stake_f {eq,beta,pareto} STRING: Generator function for inital stake distrib.
  --sim {random,const,geom,log_const,log_geom} STRING: Indicate simulator class
     #+end_src

     So the program requires a flag for each simulation parameter,
     plus an optional id argument. The id argument is not necessary for
     basic usage, and i suggest using the docker setup for batch execution
     anyways (which manages experiment ids independently)
     so it may be removed in subsequent releases.

** Test the installation

     An example of well formed command would be:

     ~$ sim-stake --m 3 --T 200 --c 0.5 --stake_f eq --sim random --times 10~

     Which would run the simulation with:
     - $m=3$ nodes
     - for $T=200$ epochs,
     - with a load factor $c=0.5$
     - initial stake $stake_f=eq$
     - $sim=random$ scheme,
     - repeating the experiment 10 times ($times=10$)

     A csv is produced on standard output which looks like:

     #+begin_src text

     All simulation parameters are reported for each row along with
     the observed result metrics, so that each result is fully characterized
     by its csv output (i.e. 2 outputs can merged in a single dataframe without loss
     of information)

     Use output redirection to save the results to a file for later inspection:

     ~$ sim-stake --m 3 --T 200 --c 0.5 --stake_f eq --sim random --times 10 > some_name.csv~

*** NOTE
    Running the simulation as saw above works for simple tests
    with a single parameters combination.
    For a full fledged experiment with parameter manipulation see either
    section [[sec:usingaslib]] (using as library) or section [[sec:dockermode]] (docker mode).

** Using as library
   <<sec:usingaslib>>

   Once installed the code can also be used as library.
   In the module *sim.core.main* exposes a =run= function
   that accepts the parameters you would provide on the command line
   as a dictionary (without the =--= prefix on parameters name).

   In a python script of your choice:

   #+begin_src python
   import sim.core.main as simulation

   params = {'m':3,
             'T':300,
	     'c':0.5,
             'stake_f':'eq',
             'sim':'random',
	     'times':10}

   simulation.run(params)
   #+end_src

   The run function accepts 2 other optional named parameters:
   - =out_fn= (default = sys.stdout.write)
   - =header= (default = True)

   The =out_fn= will be called for each simulation repetition
   passing a string being the comma separated values (parameter + response metrics)
   i.e. =times= times once per line of the output csv.

   The =header= boolean controls whether the header of the csv should be produced
   before the first run results.

*** Simple experiment

    A simple experiment can be conducted by writing a procedure
    that runs several simulations:

    Let's say we want to manipulate the number of nodes $m$:

   #+begin_src python
   import sim.core.main as simulation

   ms = range(2,10)

   params = {'m':None,
             'T':300,
	     'c':0.5,
             'stake_f':'eq',
             'sim':'random',
	     'times':10}

   header = True
   for m in ms:
       params['m'] = m
       simulation.run(params,header=header)
       if header:
           header=False
   #+end_src

   Note that we ensure that the header is only produced
   on the first parameter combination so we get a valid csv
   as output.

*** Experiment definition grammar

    Although the above is sufficient for simple experiments,
    relying on procedural code may hide the essence of the
    experiment in complex scenario, rendering difficult to infer what
    is tested. A more declarative approach ensured readability and clarity.

    In order to define experiment in a pleasant way a module
    was defined to provide a definition grammar for complex experiments.

    The fundamental idea is providing a callable data structure that
    represents the Cartesian product of named sets. Once called the ds
    will expand to a list of dictionaries where each key assumes one of the
    values of its set.

    The ~sim.executor.batch.ibatch~ module provides the constructor ~P~
    for these Cartesian expansions.

    #+begin_src python
    from pprint import pprint
    from sim.executor.batch.ibatch import P

    p1 = P({'a':{True,False},
            'b':{True,False}})

    pprint(p1())
    #+end_src

    Which produces the following output:

    #+begin_src python
    [{'a': True, 'b': True},
     {'a': True, 'b': False},
     {'a': False, 'b': True},
     {'a': False, 'b': False}]
    #+end_src

    Typically the values of the dictionary provided to the P constructor
    will be sets (thus ensuring no duplicates) but any iterable or callable
    that returns an iterable is fine, so the following is acceptable:

    #+begin_src python
    from pprint import pprint
    from sim.executor.batch.ibatch import P

    def i_could_be_a_very_complex_function():
        "...complex compute..."
	return {True,False}

    p2 = P({'n': range(1,4),
            'b': i_could_be_a_very_complex_function})

    pprint(p2())
    #+end_src

    Which produces:

    #+begin_src python
    [{'b': False, 'n': 1},
     {'b': True, 'n': 1},
     {'b': False, 'n': 2},
     {'b': True, 'n': 2},
     {'b': False, 'n': 3},
     {'b': True, 'n': 3}]
    #+end_src

    If we only desire a segments of the product (i.e. some value should only
    be matched with specific ones) then chaining 2 separate P constructor
    suffices. To chain constructors just use the =+= operator:

    #+begin_src python
    from pprint import pprint
    from sim.executor.batch.ibatch import P

    p3 = P({'mode': {"a"},
            'sub_mode': {"a1","a2"}})

    p4 = P({'mode': {"b"},
            'sub_mode':{"b1","b2"}})

    p5 = p3 + p4

    pprint(p5())
    #+end_src

    #+begin_src python
    [{'mode': 'a', 'sub_mode': 'a1'},
     {'mode': 'a', 'sub_mode': 'a2'},
     {'mode': 'b', 'sub_mode': 'b1'},
     {'mode': 'b', 'sub_mode': 'b2'}]
    #+end_src
